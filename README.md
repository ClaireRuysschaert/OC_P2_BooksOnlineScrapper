# How to use the script

## Required software and tools
Before getting started, you need to install python 3 and git on your computer. 
You will also need to choose a code editor, for example VScode or PyCharm. 

## Getting started

Create and activate a virtual environment.

MacOs/Linux:
> python3 -m venv .venv
> .venv/bin/activate

Windows:
> python -m venv .venv
> .venv/Script/activate

Then you can install all the requirements for the script.
> pip install -r requirements.txt

## Launch the script
You can now launch the **scrapper.py** that will extract the data from Books to Scrap.
